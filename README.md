Other Notes
-------------

Use [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.github.com/) to download the image files before compiling the document.

The main paper tex doc is `dissertation/outline.tex`

Downloading the .zip file from here results in corrupted images, it is far easier to download [git bash](https://gitforwindows.org/), but this requires basic knowledge of windows cmd/git bash language (if you're nervous about that, just go to Overleaf listed above).
